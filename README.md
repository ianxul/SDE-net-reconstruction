# SDENet-Inference
The idea of this project is to be able to reconstruct Hurwitz matrices ($A$) using a combination of Transfer Entropy methods and a theorem from control theory which gives us the set of possible $A$ matrices given the correlation matrix. More details in the written document.

This repository holds the scripts used.
