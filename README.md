# CorTe-Inference
The idea of this project is to be able to reconstruct Hurwitz matrices (A) using a combination of Transfer Entropy methods and a theorem from control theory which gives us the set of possible A matrices given the correlation matrix. More details in the written document.

This repository will hold the scripts I will be using and it will also be useful to track changes. In the "Projects" section there will be a list of ToDos and the "Issues" section will hold problems that must be addressed.
